# Projects for Grow With Google Front-End classes
These are course projects for the Udacity/Grow with Google bootcamp scholarship program.

- Two course projects (trading card and pixel maker) are within the GWG folder.
- Data App is a quick example I made for a student discussion of front-end development for data products.
